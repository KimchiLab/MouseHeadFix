# MouseHeadFix
Equipment for lab mouse experiments facilitated by head fixation  

### Files
Files include both [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) **.blend** design files as well as exported **.STL** files for 3D printing. These files have been printed previously on a FlashForge Creator Pro in Black PLA, but should be printable on many other 3D printers

### [HeadBar](HeadBar/)
The head bar should be placed horizontally on the mouse's skull and secured with a firm cement such as MetaBond. The centering tab is not necessary and only included to make aligning with the midline slightly easier. Without the tab the bar can be machined easily using 2mm x 2mm stock aluminum or another metal
